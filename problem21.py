# Longest Common Prefix

# Write a function to find the longest common prefix string 
# amongst an array of strings.
# If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

## Example
# Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
# Output: "fl"

# Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
# Output: ""
# Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.

# Understading the problem
# I believe we need to use the method of len(strs) to grab each length of each word in the array
# And then use the If statement to grab the longest common prefix in the array
# then return the longest common prefix or empty string if none exists
